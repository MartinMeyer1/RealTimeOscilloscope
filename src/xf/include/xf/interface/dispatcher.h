 * an internal thread. It is up to the port implementation how
 * the class behaves.
 *
 * The dispatcher should at least provide a queue to hold events
 * and an algorithm (typically in execute()) that dispatches the queued
 * events to the associated behavior (eq. state machine, activity).
 *
 * There may exist multiple dispatchers. Each behavior needs to be
 * bound to a dispatcher. One dispatcher may serve different behaviors.
 *
 * In an IDF the attribute _pThread is usually null.
